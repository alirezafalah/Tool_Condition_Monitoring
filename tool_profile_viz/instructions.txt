How to Run "Tool Profile Viz"
=================================

This guide provides the steps to set up and run the Tool Profile Visualization application from the shared OneDrive folder.

--- Prerequisites ---

1.  **Python 3.9+**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  **OneDrive Desktop App**: You must have the OneDrive client installed and running.

--- 1. Setup Instructions ---

1.  **Access the Shared Folder**:
    Accept the invitation to the "Data Visualizer" folder. Make sure it is syncing to your computer via the OneDrive desktop application. 

2.  **Navigate to the App Directory**:
    Open a terminal in the folder (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Linux/macOS). You can also navigate into the application's folder using the `cd` command. The path will look something like this (please be mindful that you should be in tool_profile_viz which is the app directory):
    "...\Data Visualizer\tool_profile_viz"


3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Run the following command in the terminal once to install the required Python libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

--- 2. Understanding Data Sync (Important!) ---

The `data` folder is very large (~100 GB). By default, OneDrive uses "Files On-Demand" to save space.


For the best performance, it is **highly recommended** to download the entire dataset once:
1.  Navigate to the "Data Visualizer" folder in your File Explorer.
2.  Right-click on the `data` folder.
3.  Select "Always keep on this device".
4.  Wait for the sync to complete (this may take a long time).

--- 3. Running the Application ---

Once setup is complete, you can run the application.

**On Windows:**
Make sure your terminal is inside the `tool_profile_viz` directory and run:
python main.py

**On Linux / macOS:**
Make sure your terminal is inside the `tool_profile_viz` directory and run:
python3 main.py
